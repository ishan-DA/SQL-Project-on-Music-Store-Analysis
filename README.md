# SQL-Project-on-Music-Store-Analysis


In this project, we will be analyzing data from a fictional music store to gain insights into the business and make data-driven recommendations.
The dataset includes information on sales, customers, products, and employees. To complete this project, we will be using SQL to query and analyze the data.
The project is divided into several questions, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data. 
We will start by exploring the data and getting familiar with the tables and relationships.
Throughout the project, I will be posing questions and trying to answer them with data analysis. 
For example, I might ask:

  Q) Who is the senior most employee based on job title?                      
  Q) Which countries have the most invoices?                
  Q) What are top 3 values of total invoice?

By the end of the project, we will have gained valuable insights into the music store's business and made data-driven recommendations for improving performance.
